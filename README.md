        I am constantly learning new things everyday and love meeting people who shares the same passion and interest as me.




- 👀 I’m interested in ...

        How user interact with design and the theory behind users behaviours.

        It may not sound conventional but my freetime I love to do bodybuilding and powerlifting.

      It may not be optimal in my role, for me to understand javascript,
      however I am still learning it for myself.

      I could not before due to technical limitations.
